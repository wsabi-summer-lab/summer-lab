# For Model 1, the p-value for SECOND_TTO is 7.898e-08, indicating a significant effect.
# However, in Model 2, the p-value for SECOND_TTO is greater than 0.05 after adding
# ORDER_CT, suggesting that the effect is no longer significant.

# Not significant, as all efficients about ordering have p-values greater than 0.05.
