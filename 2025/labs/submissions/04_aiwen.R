## interpretation of logistic regression coefs:
# increase in 1 yard away from opponent's end zone --> decrease in 0.1ish in log odds on average; 
# i.e., odds decrease by 10% for each 1 yard we move further back from end zone.
# increase in 1 unit of kicker quality --> increase in 0.277 ish in log odds on average;
# i.e., odds decrease by 27.7% ish for a unit increase in kicker quality.
