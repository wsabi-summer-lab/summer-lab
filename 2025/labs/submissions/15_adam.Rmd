RIDGGGG

  alpha = 0,
  lambda = lambdas,
  nfolds = 5,
  family = "gaussian",

l_min = ridge_model$lambda.min

```

lets draw some stuf!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# OLS: get player coefficients
ols_coefs <- coef(ols_model)

# Ridge: get player coefficients at best lambda
ridge_coefs <- coef(ridge_model, s = ridge_model$lambda.min)

ols_df <- tibble(

)

ridge_df <- tibble(
  player = rownames(ridge_coefs),
  effect_ridge = as.vector(ridge_coefs)
) %>%
  filter(player != "(Intercept)")
coef_df <- left_join(ols_df, ridge_df, by = "player") %>%
  mutate(player = str_remove(player, "player_"))  # clean player IDs

ggplot(coef_df, aes(x = effect_ols, y = effect_ridge)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray") +

anotha one! - DJ Khaled

```{r, echo = FALSE}
top_players <- coef_df %>%
  arrange(desc(effect_ridge)) %>%
  slice(1:10)

bottom_players <- coef_df %>%
  arrange(effect_ridge) %>%
  slice(1:10)

top_bottom <- bind_rows(top_players, bottom_players)

ggplot(top_bottom, aes(x = fct_reorder(player, effect_ridge), y = effect_ridge, fill = effect_ridge > 0)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Top and Bottom Players by Ridge APM",
    x = "Player ID",
    y = "Ridge Coefficient"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "steelblue")) +
  theme_minimal()

```

oops I did it again

```{r, echo = FALSE}
comparison_df <- top_bottom %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(effect_ols, effect_ridge),
    names_to = "model",
    values_to = "estimate"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    player = fct_reorder(player, estimate)  # reorders within facets
  )

ggplot(comparison_df, aes(x = player, y = estimate, fill = model)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(width = 0.7), width = 0.6) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("effect_ols" = "gray60", "effect_ridge" = "steelblue"),
                    labels = c("OLS", "Ridge")) +
  labs(
    title = "Top and Bottom Players: OLS vs Ridge APM",
    x = "Player ID",
    y = "Estimated Effect (Points per Possession)",
    fill = "Model"

low k kinda wild that one. peace and love baby
